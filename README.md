# Android Devices Minimum Screen Width Table
Reference chart of Android Devices and their corresponding Smallest-Width dimension, as a guide for Android Developers to create alternative layout resources (sw320dp, sw480dp, etc). If you ever wanted your app to look good on all devices, you know what I am talking about.

## Usage
Find the corresponding smallest-width segment your device belongs to in the table below, to create 
alternative resources (layouts, dimens, strings, etc) for it in Android Studio. If your device isn't 
listed, consider contributing: clone this repository, open in Android Studio and run in your device.
A single activity will display the corresponding smallest-width segment. Then create a pull request
with the info.
